# Executing tasks in an executor that returns a result

One of the advantages of the Executor framework is that we can run concurrent tasks that return a result.

The Java Concurrency API archieves this with the following two interfaces:

* `Callable` interface has the `call()` method, we can implement the logic of a tak in this method. The `Callable` interface is a parameterized interface, meaning we have to indicate the type of data the `call()` method will return.
* `Feature` interface has some methods to obtain the result generated by a `Callable` object and to manage its status.


`Callable<T>`
* `T call()`

`Feature`

* `isDone()` check if the tasks had finished.
* `get()` get the result returned by `call()` method. This method waits/blocks until the `Callable` object has finished the execution of `call()` method and has returned its result. If the thread is interrupted while the `get()` method is waiting for the result, it throws an `InterruptedException` exception. If the `call()` method throws an eception, this method throwsan `ExecutionException`.
* `get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` if the result of the task is not available, waits for the specified time. return `null` when timeout.


e.g. Implement tasks that return a result and run them on a executor.
