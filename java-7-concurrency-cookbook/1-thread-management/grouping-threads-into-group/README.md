# Grouping threads into a group

`ThreadGroup` to work with group of threads. A `ThreadGroup` object can be formed by `Thread` objects and by another `ThreadGroup` object, generating a tree structure of threads.

* `list()` information about the ThreadGroup object
* `activeCount()` get thread objects associated with the ThreadGroup object
* `enumerate()` get a list of active threads in ThreadGoup

e.g. [Result.java](grouping-threads-into-group/Result.java) [SearchTask.java](grouping-threads-into-group/SerachTask.java)
